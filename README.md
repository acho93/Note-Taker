# Note Taker

## Description
This application allows users to write, save, and delete notes. I was provided with the front end code and tasked with creating the back end code using express.js and then connecting the two to create a functional note-taking application.

You can check out the deployed app here: https://fast-bayou-40029.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
You will need to run npm install to install all dependencies. To use the application locally, run npm start and open http://localhost:3001/ in your brower.
